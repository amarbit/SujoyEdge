# title: Structural Similarity Index
# ---

# When comparing images, the **Mean Squared Error** (or MSE), though straightforward to calculate,
# may not be a very good indicator of their *perceived* similarity.

# The **Structural Similarity Index** (or SSIM) aims to address this shortcoming by taking texture
# into account, and assigning a higher score to images that may *appear* similar.


using Images, TestImages
using Random

img_orig = float64.(testimage("cameraman"))

# We use a grayscale image out of the `TestImages` package, which provides a
# standard suite of test images. `float`/`float32`/`float64` preserve colorant
# information: thus the image is now composed of pixels of type `Gray{Float64}`.

assess_ssim(img_orig, img_orig)

# The `assess_ssim` function, which takes two images as inputs and returns their
# structural similarity index, is the simplest way to calculate the SSIM of two images.

# An SSIM score of `1.00` indicates perfect structural similarity, as is expected
# out of identical images.

# Now, we create two variations of the original image: `image_const` on the left has the intensity of
# all its pixels increased by `0.2` times the intensity range, while `image_noise` on the right has the
# intensity of some of its pixels increased, and that of the others decreased by the same
# amount. The two images look quite different visually.

noise = ones(size(img_orig)) .* 0.2 .* (maximum(img_orig) - minimum(img_orig))
img_const = img_orig + noise

mask = rand(Float64, size(img_orig)) .< 0.5
noise[mask] = noise[mask] .* -1
img_noise = img_orig + noise

mosaicview(img_const, img_noise; nrow=1)
save("assets/ssim.png", img_noise) #src

# We use the `mse` funtion defined in `ImageDistances` to calculate the mean squared
# error between the original and the two modified images.

mse(img_orig, img_const), mse(img_orig, img_noise)

# Despite their visual differences, both the images have the exact same mean squared error
# of `0.400`, when compared with the original. This demonstrates how in certain cases, MSE
# can fail to capture the *perceived* similarity of images.

assess_ssim(img_orig, img_const), assess_ssim(img_orig, img_noise)

# Their SSIM scores vary significantly, with `image_const` being rated much closer
# to the original image in terms of perceived similarity, which is in line with what
# visually seems to be the case.

# ### Custom Parameters

# While `assess_ssim` is a convenient way to calculate the SSIM of two images, it
# does not allow for custom parameters to be passed to the SSIM algorithm, for which
# we have the following syntax.

iqi = SSIM(KernelFactors.gaussian(2.0, 11), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
assess(iqi, img_orig, img_const)

# Here, the first parameter is the kernel used to weight the neighbourhood of each
# pixel while calculating the SSIM locally, and defaults to `KernelFactors.gaussian(1.5, 11)`.
# The second parameter is the set of weights (α, β, γ) given to the *lunimance* (L),
# *contrast* (C) and *structure* (S) terms while calculating the SSIM,
# and defaults to `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`.
# Recall that SSIM is defined as Lᵅ × Cᵝ × Sᵞ.
