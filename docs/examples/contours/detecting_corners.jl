# title: Detecting Corners
# ---

# Corner Detection, which is a subset of Interest Point Detection, tries to detect
# points in the image which have a well-defined position and can be robustly detected
# in multiple images of the same scene. Very often, these points lie along the corners
# or edges of objects in the image - hence the name.

# Corner detection is useful in several computer vision tasks - such as Image Registration,
# Motion Detection and Panaroma Stitching. This is because if the locations of the same
# points are known in two different images, it gives a reference to align those images. Corners,
# with their well-defined positions serve as good candidates for such points.

using Images, TestImages
img = Gray.(testimage("house"))

# We use this image of a house, with numerous edges and corners.

# The `imcorner` function can be used to detect corners in the image - and it returns an
# array of booleans, where a `true` value denotes that the corresponding pixel may be a
# corner. We use this to mark those pixels in red on a copy of the image.

corners = imcorner(img)
img_copy = RGB.(img)
img_copy[corners] .= RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
img_copy

# As you can see, several points which lie in the interior of the object (the house)
# have also been detected as corners. We can fix this by specifying a higher threshold percentile.

corners = imcorner(img, Percentile(98.5))
img_copy2 = RGB.(img)
img_copy2[corners] .= RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
img_copy2
save("assets/corner.png", img_copy2) #src

# This seems much better. A detailed documentation of the function parameters can be found in
# the documentation of [`imcorner`](@ref).

# Internally, `imcorner` uses one of three algorithms: *Harris*, *Shi Tomasi* or
# *Kitchen Rosenfield* to detect corners. Which one to use can be specified using
# the `method` parameter to `imcorner`. Each algorithm also has a separate method.

detection_methods = [harris, shi_tomasi, kitchen_rosenfeld]
img_copies = [RGB.(img) for i in 1:length(detection_methods)]
for i in 1:length(detection_methods)
    corners = imcorner(img, Percentile(98.5); method=detection_methods[i])
    img_copies[i] = RGB.(img)
    img_copies[i][corners] .= RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# These algorithms use the gradient of the image to identify corners, because intensities
# change abruptly at corner points, giving rise to large gradients. However, this makes them
# computationally expensive.

# The *FAST (Features from Accelarated Segment Test) Corner Detector* is a feature
# detection algorithm which is designed to be computationally cheaper, and hence much faster.
# It classifies a pixel $P$ as a corner if at least $n$ contiguous points out of the 16
# points in a circle around it have intensities either higher (or lower) than that of $P$
# by a certain threshold $t$.

corners = fastcorners(img, 11, 0.1) # fastcorners(img, n, t) where n and t are optional
